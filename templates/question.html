		<p>
			Election administration in the United States is one of the most visible manifestations of federalism.  Taken to its extreme in some states, elections can be run all the way down at the township level (Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and others), though, the majority of states run elections at the county or county-equivalent level. I was an advisor to the <a href="http://www.supportthevoter.gov/">Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a> (PCEA), and in my current role at the <a href="http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a> (BPC), I continue to develop policy and advocate election reforms across the country.

			The most common refrain from local and state legislators, policymakers, and election administrators is that the states are completely unique and one-size-does-not-fit-all when it comes to election policy. And that may be true to some extent, but our counties' similarities are likely far more important than their differences.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Research Question: Are elections in different states really different or are there themes that characterize similar jurisdictions no matter where they are and lend support to the idea that a set of best election policies exists?
