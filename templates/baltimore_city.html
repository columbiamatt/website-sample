		<h1>Baltimore City</h1>
		<hr />

		<p>Baltimore City is the fourth largest county or county-equivalent in the State of Maryland based on the 2014 registration data.</p>

		<br>

		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li>In 2012, Baltimore city had 360,080 registered voters.  By 2014, that number was 373,171.</li>   
			<li>In 2012, Baltimore city's turnout of registered voters was 71.49% and in 2014 it was 37.84%.  The statewide averages were 75.33% and 47.14%, respectively.</li> 
			<li>In 2012, the city had 861 voters per polling place, ranking 6th out of 24 counties in this metric. In 2014, the county had 486 voters per polling place, ranking 4th out of 24 counties.  The statewide average of voters per polling place in 2012 was 1,264 and the median was 1,198.  In 2014, the average voters per polling place statewide was 808 voters and the median was also 808 voters.</li>
			<li>In 2012, the city had 59 voters per poll worker, ranking 3rd out of 24 counties in this metric. In 2014, the city had 41 voters per poll worker, ranking 4th out of 24 counties.  The statewide average of voters per poll worker in 2012 was 88 voters and the median was 87 voters.  In 2014, the average voters per poll worker statewide was 60 voters and the median was 61 voters.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<p>Baltimore City performed even better than expected, ranking near the top in both 2012 and 2014 for voters per polling place and voters per poll worker.  The city may be under extra pressure to provide more poll workers than other jurisdictions in order to provide language minority assistance.  Also, the polling places might be physically smaller in an urban environment, necessitating more locations and more poll workers in turn.</p>
