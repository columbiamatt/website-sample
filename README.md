## Maryland Election Administration Project

## Synopsis of project

This website is part of a Johns Hopkins class that uses Python to collect and analyze data. The website showcases all the skills learned in the class.

In my project, I used Election Administration bulk data in CSV format. I cleaned the data where possible when I found obviously incorrect data. In some cases, I was unable to do so and I will note where I do not believe the data are accurate in my results. I created metrics for voters in a single state to compare how their election officials (in this case, county-level officials) are conducting elections. I chose Maryland because it is where I currently live and because the data were some of the most complete statewide.

## Data

Election administration data from the bienniel Election Administration and Voting Surveys in 2012 and 2014.
